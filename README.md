### Description

This code is a COMPLETE library of functions which allows to recover more informations about files/folders/disks (logical and physical) and faster than FileSystemObject.

It replaces totally FSO as it is faster, more complete and easy to use.

There is about 100 functions and 80 properties availables.

Thanks for your comments, and sorry for my bad english (I'm french ^^)

If you have ANY IDEA to improve performances of this classes, please post a comment ! Thanks.
